Zealanders have loved dressing up. From patriotic fundraisers and Sunday school picnics to fancy dress balls and the Rugby Sevens, Kiwis seem to find any excuse to get glammed up. On this topic, Marguerite Hill (heritage researcher for Auckland Council, long-time curator and textile expert) will deliver an illustrated presentation featuring fancy-dress makers of nineteen and twentieth century New Zealand, as well as some absolutely fabulous examples of ingenious Kiwi costuming.</p>\n                <p>Following Marguerite, city planner Wayne Siu wants you to know why he wears dead people’s clothes, and why you should too. A sustainability expert and vintage fashion enthusiast with a particular interest in menswear from the 20’s, 30’s, and 40’s, Wayne will educate you on the current resurgence of slow fashion, and its deeper meanings and repercussions. Drawn to the complexity, detailing and quality found in clothing of the past, Wayne is also concerned with style meeting substance - not just an aesthetic preference for dedicated dandies, vintage clothing is a fashion choice which is ethical, just, and protects our planet.</p>\n    \t\t  <EventSubscribe />\n            </Col>\n    \t</Row>\n        <Row className=\"row-eq-height\">\n            <Col md=\"3\" id=\"makesewdo-image\">\n            </Col>\n            <Col md=\"3\" className=\"row-card dark-grey-bg white-text\">\n                <div className=\"vertical-center text-center\">\n                    <h2>Make, Do, Mend<br />\n                    <span className=\"mid-text\">Daily sessions 10-2, additional sessions Mon-Wed 4-8<br />Makerspace, Ground Floor</span></h2>\n                </div>\n            </Col>\n            <Col md=\"6\" className=\"row-card\">\n                <p>The Make, Do and Mend program is a series of sewing, stitching and repurposing workshops, crafted by the teams at the Central City Library and New Zealand Fashion Week.
